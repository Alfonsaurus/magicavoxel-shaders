> A collection of shaders for [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/) to generate geometry, noise, patterns, and simplify common and repetitive tasks.

## Installation

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/lachlanmcdonald/magicavoxel-shaders/releases/) and copy the files from the `shader` directory into the `shader` directory of your MagicaVoxel installation.

## Shaders

See a [complete list of shader, documentation and examples on the wiki][wiki].

## Issues & Suggestions

If you encounter an issue with these shaders or would like to suggest your own, please review any [open issues][open-issues] and [create a new issue][new-issue] if one does not exist already.

> **No arguments are shown when selecting a shader**
>
> Recent versions of MagicaVoxel are GPU-accelerated and different GPU manufacturers have unique quirks in their handling of shaders. 
> - If some shaders work but not others, please [create a new issue][new-issue] or post to `#questions-and-help` in the [MagicaVoxel Community Discord][discord-invite].
> - If no shaders are working, including shaders that are included with MagicaVoxel, it is likely that your GPU is unsupported. Older, integrated, or Intel GPU's often do not support shaders.
